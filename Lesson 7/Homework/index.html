            Hello? I've had a bit of a tumble. They just toss us away like yesterday's jam. Yeah, you do know how a
            button works don't you? No, not on clothes. It's my term for my time of the month. Oh. What time of the
            month? The weekend? I am a man, he's a man, we're men! Ok, tell me how your feeling. I feel delicate... and
            annoyed, and... I think I'm ugly. Hello, IT. Have you tried forcing an unexpected reboot?
          </p>
          <p>
            Oh my God. I didn't even know Smarties made a cereal. They don't. It's just Smarties in a bowl with milk.
            I've got Aunt Irma visiting. Oh, do you not like Aunt Irma? I've got an aunt like that. Graphic
            homoeroticism? Does that mean they're going to get them out? When I started Reynholm Industries, I had just
            two things in my possession: a dream and 6 million pounds. Today I have a business empire the like of which
            the world has never seen the like of which. I hope it doesn't sound arrogant when I say that I am the
            greatest man in the world! Hello, IT. Have you tried forcing an unexpected reboot?
          </p>
          <p>
            I'm a 32 year old IT-man who works in a basement. Yes, I do the whole Lonely Hearts thing! How long have you
            been disabled? Ten years? Ten years, and how did it happen? If that's not a rude question. Acid? OK. Moss,
            what did you have for breakfast this morning? Smarties cereal. Nicer ambulances, faster response times and
            better looking drivers mean they're not just the Emergency Services, they're your Emergency Services. When I
            started Reynholm Industries, I had just two things in my possession: a dream and 6 million pounds.
